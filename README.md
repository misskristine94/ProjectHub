# ProjectHub
A sample project dashboard landing page design that you can use as design inspiration or modify and make it work for your next project! ðŸš€

Please note this is a mini prototype/proof of concept to help you get started on your next project, not a fully working application ready to be deployed to production.  You can modify the data in the collections in the App OnStart property to see how the charts change. 

The .zip is an app package, and not a solution, and so you'll need to navigate to make.powerapps.com, then 'Apps', and then import the app as a Canvas App as you can see in the screenshot below :)
